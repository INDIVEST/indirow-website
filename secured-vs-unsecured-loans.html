                                Secured loans often come with lower interest rates, making them an attractive option for borrowers seeking affordable financing.

                            </h6>
                            <p>
                                Due to the collateral involved, secured loans typically offer higher loan amounts, which can be advantageous for significant expenses like buying a home or a vehicle.

                        </li>

                                Risk of Losing Collateral
                            </h6>
                            <p>
                                The primary disadvantage is the risk of losing your collateral if you fail to repay the loan as agreed, potentially putting your assets at stake.

                        </li>

                            </h6>
                            <p>
                                Secured loans may involve a more extended approval process due to the need for collateral assessment.

                                Due to the absence of collateral, unsecured loans often have higher interest rates compared to secured options.
